        <h1>Nikita Gandhi</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Abu Dhabi, Gandhi developed a love for intricate culinary techniques and food pairings from a young age, starting to cook independently at just eight years old. After working in finance, she auditioned for Season 4 MasterChef India, where she was crowned the youngest ever winner in 2015.</p>
        <p>Winner of the fourth season of the Indian version of Masterchef – 
            Nikita Gandhi is the youngest yet to win this prestigious title.
            Born and brought up in Abu Dhabi, Nikita flew down to India exclusively to participate in Masterchef and boy was it worth it! The lack of a professional culinary background could dither this young girl from achieving her goals. Having started cooking from the tender age of 8 years, nikita also writes a food blog called The veggie fix . This is what she says on it- The Veggie Fix brings you recipes tested to perfection! From drinks to desserts to fusion twists on the old classics, I have put my heart into discovering exactly what works, so you can make these flawlessly at home. Go ahead and try them; get your daily veggie fix!</p>
